# My-Repository
A "scratch" repository for learning, ideas, and miscellaneous resources.

Hello World,
I am TJ Staats, an aspiring data scientist. My interests include statistics, machine learning, and the python programming language. I am familiar with Java and C++ as well as HTML and CSS. I am currently taking an online video course for Data Science in Python. Soon I hope to be working on my own projects using the knowledge I've gained from what I've learned. My goal is to become a professional Data Scientist employed at a company I love to work for.
